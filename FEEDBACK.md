Overall, the Uber API is a pleasure to use and easy to access -- it makes a lot of immediate sense.

However, these are some of the improvements I would suggest:
* A list of wrappers and libraries in different languages -- sure these are easy to find with a quick Google search, but the idea is to keep developers on the Uber page itself whenever possible
* It would be cool to see a more in depth tutorial giving step by step instructions on writing the code itself and what each line of code does. How cool would it be if a beginning developed stumbled upon Uber as her first API?
* I would also like to see a more in depth and accessible explanation of how to make ride requests in the provided sandbox so you DON'T end up charging your own credit card. For some developers, this could create a point of uncertainty, and rather than persist through the elarning process, they might just bail on it all together.
* Does Uber provide any style sheets with the Uber design guidelines already implemented? The easier it is for developers to plug into, the better I think.
